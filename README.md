This project is basically for Engineering Undergraduate students learning 'C' programming.
The project assumes that the student has alreay gone through the concepts of structure and pointers in detail.
This project mainly aims to asses the quality of the coding skills of the student after he has gone through the course on 'C' programming.
A team can also be created among students for this project to evaluate 
1: How they manages code changes?
2: Individual contribution?
3: Team contribution?

The score (out of 100) of the student/s will be evaluated as
1: No of required functionality covered (50)
2: Adherence to coding standards (20)
3: Adherence to time line (30)


Required functionality with weightage
1. Directly input text to the 
2.
