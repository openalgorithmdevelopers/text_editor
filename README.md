A console based text editor to be written in 'C' language using Linked list concept. This project is basically for Engineering Undergraduate students learning 'C' programming. The project assumes that the student has already gone through the concepts of structure and pointers in detail. 
This project mainly aims to assess the quality of the coding skills of the student after he has gone through the course on 'C' programming. 
A team can also be created among students for this project to evaluate
 1: How they manage code changes? 
2: Individual contribution?
 3: Team contribution?
The score (out of 100) of the student/s will be evaluated as 
1: No of required functionality covered (50) 
2: Adherence to coding standards (20) 
3: Adherence to time line (30)
Required functionality with weightage (%)
1.	Directly input text to the list ( w/o using ‘yourText’)	[10]
Hint: Take any sequence of characters (for e.g. -000) as the sequence to quit inputting characters to text
2.	Create a function to insert text at any index into the List as provided by user [5]
3.	Create a function to insert text at the start of the List	[5]
4.	Create a function to delete any text from the List	[10]
5.	Give user the option to open a file and load it to the list		]25]
6.	After 5 is implemented the user can search any word if its present in the file	[15]
7.	After 5 is implemented the user can do 2, 3, 4 on the opened file and save it as well [30]
